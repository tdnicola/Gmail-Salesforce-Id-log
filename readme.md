## Current work in progress

> Problem: Receiving SF emails with errors on SF IDS.

> Solution: Python to search gmail through google gmail API and store Salesforce Ids into a doc to inspect later.

Todo:
1. organize the writing of the Ids into another function
2. Upload the files to google sheets
3. refactor it all.
